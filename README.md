# Customer Segmentation: Business-Oriented Clustering Algorithms

Take a look of the project: https://nbviewer.org/github/CeloCruz/CustomerSegmentation/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation_Final_Github.ipynb

## Project Overview
The Customer Personality Analysis project focuses on understanding and analyzing customer behavior to help businesses modify their products based on specific customer segments. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to uncover customer segments and gain valuable business insights.

## Problem Statement
The primary goal of this project, from both a business and data scientist perspective, is to understand customers better and tailor products to their specific needs, behaviors, and concerns within different customer segments.

## Data Source
The dataset for this project is provided by Dr. Omar Romero-Hernandez.

## Performance Measure
In unsupervised learning, performance assessment involves both quantitative and qualitative methods. Notable quantitative techniques include the Silhouette Score, which quantifies cluster separation, and the Elbow Method, which helps determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Key Phases
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A comprehensive EDA is performed with a business perspective to gain insights into customer behavior and needs.
2. **Clustering Algorithms:** Various clustering algorithms are applied, including hierarchical and DBSCAN, with KMeans emerging as the winning choice.
3. **Iterative Process:** The project goes through an iterative process to achieve satisfactory results from a business perspective.
4. **Results Presentation:** The outcomes are presented in a user-friendly format.

## Conclusion
Customer Personality Analysis plays a crucial role in helping businesses understand their customers and adapt their products accordingly. This project serves as a guide for delving into advanced clustering techniques and uncovering valuable business insights.
